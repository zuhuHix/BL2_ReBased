# Decisions and evidence

## 2026-09-10: Start with an engine-independent package reader

C++20 and CMake provide a small working build before a host-engine installation.
UE5 versus Godot remains undecided. The current executable is a research tool,
not the future runtime, and accepts decompressed packages for local verification.

The table layout comes from this workspace's research/native_count.py. The new
C++ reader implements bounds validation independently and does not include its
decompressor. That Python function explicitly describes a minilzo port: its
provenance and applicable license must be established before distribution or
translation into the engine. Project license remains pending.

The initial differential check matches all nine installed code-package table
counts. This does not validate the native/script classification heuristic,
bytecode execution, all content packages, or the plan's effort estimates.

Phase 0 remains incomplete: compressed loading, property parsing, full census,
texture/mesh extraction and host rendering are outstanding. The Sanctuary
weekly gate becomes applicable once a map loader exists.

## 2026-09-10: Direct compressed code-package loading verified

Supersedes the compressed-loading status above. The C++ reader now validates
fully compressed container headers and block sizes, decodes through upstream
`lzo1x_decompress_safe`, and verifies each output length. The dependency is
optional and disabled by default. See THIRD_PARTY.md for the pinned archive,
license, and remaining Python provenance uncertainty. This is not a permanent
host-engine dependency decision or a project-wide license selection.

The nine-package comparison now passes original compressed paths to C++ and
compares the complete decoded buffer to Python's output before reading tables.
All nine match byte-for-byte. No decoded assets are saved in the repository.
The comparison is agreement between two execution paths related to miniLZO,
not an independent proof of compression-format correctness.

Container decoding rejects trailing bytes, inconsistent totals, invalid block
sizes, malformed streams, and decoded lengths over 512 MiB. Partial package
compression and all-package coverage remain unimplemented. Next work is object
records and tagged properties; host rendering and Phase 0's gate remain open.

## 2026-09-10: Object records and first tagged-property reader

The reader retains name/import/export records and exposes `--exports` JSON.
Paths resolve through local outer references, with cycle/depth checks. Import
loading across packages remains future work. Names preserve numbered FNames
and convert serialized Latin-1 or UTF-16 strings to UTF-8 JSON.

`--properties <export-index> --property-offset <bytes>` starts at an explicit
offset relative to an export. A bounded reader prevents property data escaping
that export or a tag's declared size. Scalar values and object references are
decoded. Struct/array/unknown payloads are explicitly unsupported. The offset
is required because prefix serialization differs by object type; no universal
four-byte-prefix assumption is embedded in the parser.

Evidence: the installed WillowGame Default__WeaponPartDefinition (export 36066)
has a stream at offset 4 with 11 tags and an exact end at payload byte 860.
The four-byte prefix's semantics are UNVERIFIED. This is a class default, not
a weapon-part instance. BLCMM/in-game comparison is still required, so Phase 0
step 5 is only partially complete. No game payload fixtures were committed.

Build and all three synthetic CTest suites pass. Differential verification
checks all nine code packages' decoded bytes and export fields. These tests do
not establish struct/array correctness, inheritance/default application, or
arbitrary-object property-start discovery.

## 2026-09-10: Replace miniLZO with vendored lzokay; support partial compression

Supersedes the miniLZO status above. The GPL miniLZO FetchContent path and the
`OPENWILLOW_RESEARCH_LZO` option are removed. The reader now links the MIT
lzokay decoder from `third_party/lzokay`, verified byte-identical to upstream
master `db2df1fc`, and the option is `OPENWILLOW_LZO` (default ON). Reason:
the nine-package differential check produces identical decoded bytes with
either decoder, and removing the GPL dependency removes a licensing blocker
from every enabled build. This does not select a project license and is not a
commitment to link lzokay into a future host engine.

Partially compressed packages (summary flag `0x02000000`, codec 2) are now
decoded: the chunk table is validated for monotonic, contiguous, in-bounds
ranges, each chunk is a full container decoded through the same path, and the
result is assembled at logical offsets. Synthetic tests exercise a one-chunk
package and mutations of every table field. This was required because 1,973
of the 2,008 installed packages use partial compression; only 11 are fully
compressed containers and 24 are stored uncompressed (header survey, 2026-09-10).

## 2026-09-10: Census, struct/array properties, and Phase 0 asset spikes

`--census` counts exports per class path in one package; `tools/census.py`
drives it over every `.upk`/`.umap`/`.u` under the install and refuses to
report success unless every package read. Result: 2,008 of 2,008 packages,
4,751,329 serialized exports (see README). Two UHD files with a `.upk` suffix
are byte-signature-checked and reported as sidecars rather than failures. The
count semantics are serialized copies across packages, not unique assets; the
umodel plausibility check from the plan has not been done.

Struct properties decode either as fixed layouts (`Vector`, `Rotator`, `Guid`,
`LinearColor`, `Color`, `Quat`, `Vector2D`) or as nested tagged streams, with
a depth cap of 32. Array element types are not serialized in 832/46 tags, so
they come from an explicit `--array-schema` file per probe. This is a
deliberate stopgap: the correct source is the class's UProperty reflection
data, which needs cross-package class loading (Phase 1/2). A missing schema
entry leaves the array `unsupported` rather than guessing.

`--texture` and `--mesh` are single-object spikes written against the
serialization order documented in UE Viewer (MIT; read, not copied). Texture:
largest resident mip, DXT1/DXT5 only, inline or TFC-streamed, optional
LZO-compressed bulk. Mesh: first LOD, 16-bit indices, first UV set, section
material references. Anything outside that fails loudly. `tools/prepare_probe.py`
extracts `Ash_Road01` plus its material's actual `p_Diffuse` texture from
`Ash_P.upk` and records hashes in `local/probe/probe.json`. The PNG has been
viewed and is the expected road texture; the OBJ has not been opened in Blender.

Evidence limits: `AR_Barrel_Jakobs_Sawbar` decodes fully (13 tags, zero
trailing bytes) but its values are not yet compared against BLCMM, so step 5
remains externally unverified. The offset-4 prefix observation now spans class
defaults, material instances, weapon parts, textures and meshes but is still
UNVERIFIED as a rule.

## 2026-09-10: UE5 host probe scaffolded; engine decision deferred to the gate

`host/ue5/OpenWillow` is a minimal UE5 C++ project plus an editor Python
import script, following the plan's UE5 recommendation. It has not been built
or run because UE5 is not installed on the development machine. The Phase 0
gate (mesh and texture rendered in the host engine, screenshot captured) and
the UE5-versus-Godot decision therefore remain open. The scaffold is committed
so the gate can be attempted as a self-contained next task; it must not be
read as evidence that the engine choice is made.
