# Decisions and evidence

## 2026-09-10: Start with an engine-independent package reader

C++20 and CMake provide a small working build before a host-engine installation.
UE5 versus Godot remains undecided. The current executable is a research tool,
not the future runtime, and accepts decompressed packages for local verification.

The table layout comes from this workspace's research/native_count.py. The new
C++ reader implements bounds validation independently and does not include its
decompressor. That Python function explicitly describes a minilzo port: its
provenance and applicable license must be established before distribution or
translation into the engine. Project license remains pending.

The initial differential check matches all nine installed code-package table
counts. This does not validate the native/script classification heuristic,
bytecode execution, all content packages, or the plan's effort estimates.

Phase 0 remains incomplete: compressed loading, property parsing, full census,
texture/mesh extraction and host rendering are outstanding. The Sanctuary
weekly gate becomes applicable once a map loader exists.

## 2026-09-10: Direct compressed code-package loading verified

Supersedes the compressed-loading status above. The C++ reader now validates
fully compressed container headers and block sizes, decodes through upstream
`lzo1x_decompress_safe`, and verifies each output length. The dependency is
optional and disabled by default. See THIRD_PARTY.md for the pinned archive,
license, and remaining Python provenance uncertainty. This is not a permanent
host-engine dependency decision or a project-wide license selection.

The nine-package comparison now passes original compressed paths to C++ and
compares the complete decoded buffer to Python's output before reading tables.
All nine match byte-for-byte. No decoded assets are saved in the repository.
The comparison is agreement between two execution paths related to miniLZO,
not an independent proof of compression-format correctness.

Container decoding rejects trailing bytes, inconsistent totals, invalid block
sizes, malformed streams, and decoded lengths over 512 MiB. Partial package
compression and all-package coverage remain unimplemented. Next work is object
records and tagged properties; host rendering and Phase 0's gate remain open.

## 2026-09-10: Object records and first tagged-property reader

The reader retains name/import/export records and exposes `--exports` JSON.
Paths resolve through local outer references, with cycle/depth checks. Import
loading across packages remains future work. Names preserve numbered FNames
and convert serialized Latin-1 or UTF-16 strings to UTF-8 JSON.

`--properties <export-index> --property-offset <bytes>` starts at an explicit
offset relative to an export. A bounded reader prevents property data escaping
that export or a tag's declared size. Scalar values and object references are
decoded. Struct/array/unknown payloads are explicitly unsupported. The offset
is required because prefix serialization differs by object type; no universal
four-byte-prefix assumption is embedded in the parser.

Evidence: the installed WillowGame Default__WeaponPartDefinition (export 36066)
has a stream at offset 4 with 11 tags and an exact end at payload byte 860.
The four-byte prefix's semantics are UNVERIFIED. This is a class default, not
a weapon-part instance. BLCMM/in-game comparison is still required, so Phase 0
step 5 is only partially complete. No game payload fixtures were committed.

Build and all three synthetic CTest suites pass. Differential verification
checks all nine code packages' decoded bytes and export fields. These tests do
not establish struct/array correctness, inheritance/default application, or
arbitrary-object property-start discovery.
