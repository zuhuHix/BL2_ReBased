## 2026-09-10: Replace miniLZO with vendored lzokay; support partial compression

Supersedes the miniLZO status above. The GPL miniLZO FetchContent path and the
`OPENWILLOW_RESEARCH_LZO` option are removed. The reader now links the MIT
lzokay decoder from `third_party/lzokay`, verified byte-identical to upstream
master `db2df1fc`, and the option is `OPENWILLOW_LZO` (default ON). Reason:
the nine-package differential check produces identical decoded bytes with
either decoder, and removing the GPL dependency removes a licensing blocker
from every enabled build. This does not select a project license and is not a
commitment to link lzokay into a future host engine.

Partially compressed packages (summary flag `0x02000000`, codec 2) are now
decoded: the chunk table is validated for monotonic, contiguous, in-bounds
ranges, each chunk is a full container decoded through the same path, and the
result is assembled at logical offsets. Synthetic tests exercise a one-chunk
package and mutations of every table field. This was required because 1,973
of the 2,008 installed packages use partial compression; only 11 are fully
compressed containers and 24 are stored uncompressed (header survey, 2026-09-10).
