## 2026-09-14: Optional DLC content scope and shared-resource lookup

`--include-dlc` opts preparation and map discovery into installed DLC packages;
base-only behavior remains available. The local install exposes 82 persistent
map names. Named texture caches use a source-package-local file when duplicated,
otherwise require uniqueness. The reader still decides whether an absent cache
is needed by streamed mips; inline mip decoding is not rejected preemptively.
No texture serialization layout changed.

Numeric import references now use the existing CLI import table to check loaded
objects by path and class before an expensive global search. In DLC mode,
unresolved references try the base cooked root before the whole install; only
an absent-target error broadens that search. Validation/ambiguity errors remain
fatal. The current-install reference to `Common_Textures.Stub.StubGray_Gray`
resolves from `WillowGame`, demonstrating why the base-first order matters.
Synthetic tests cover loaded-path class matching, cache reuse, absent-target
fallback and propagation of validation errors. DLC map rendering is pending.
