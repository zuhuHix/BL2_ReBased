## 2026-09-13: cooked Material resource texture references

User explicitly approved investigating and changing cooked-material serialization.
`prepare_level.py` now reads the native Material resource prefix after the tagged
property terminator. Supported scope is version 832/46 as enforced by ow-package,
with empty compile-error and dependency arrays. Nonempty arrays are rejected;
texture counts are bounded by remaining payload bytes and resolved references
must be Texture2D or TextureCube. Other resource/shader bytes remain opaque.
No package Reader or container bounds checks were changed.

Format provenance: UE Viewer `UMaterial3::Serialize` in
https://github.com/gildor2/UEViewer/blob/master/Unreal/UnrealMaterial/UnTexture3.cpp
(read as a format reference, no code copied or translated). Upstream LICENSE.txt
was checked: MIT, Konstantin Nosov. Independent Python implementation uses the
observed prefix and existing bounded CLI export payloads; no new dependency.

Installed Sanctuary_P export 2000 (Mat_SancBuild1e) has 12 expression slots,
only two surviving references, and a 128-byte native tail. Its resource list
contains SancBuild1e_Comp, Sanctuary_Cube and SancBuild1e_Dif. Export 1882
(Master_Black) has a 68-byte tail and an empty texture list. Null expression
links must not be interpreted as a black constant or reconstructed graph.

When no named diffuse parameter exists (explicit null included), a sole
Texture2D whose path ends in _Dif or _Dif_<digits> may supply diffuse. Multiple
candidates remain unresolved. Scene metadata records source resource, texture
identities, opaque byte count and the inference method. Channel selection is
an approximation: graph connectivity, tint, masks and UV mapping are UNVERIFIED.
Native texture membership is not proof of shader-channel semantics.

Synthetic checks cover truncation, boundary mismatch, negative/oversized counts,
unsupported prefix arrays, ambiguity, explicit null and inference provenance.
