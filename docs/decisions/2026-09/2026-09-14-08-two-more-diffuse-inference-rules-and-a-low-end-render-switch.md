## 2026-09-14: Two more diffuse inference rules and a low-end render switch

Grouping Sanctuary's 64 neutral materials showed that only 31 opaque ones
(157 of 4,768 placed sections) actually rendered as gray; the translucent rest
were already invisible through the zero-opacity path. Two policy rules now
resolve most of the visible ones without reading any new cooked-resource bytes:

- **Sole non-auxiliary texture.** When the cooked texture list has no unique
  `*_Dif`/`*_Diff` Texture2D but exactly one Texture2D whose name does not end
  in a normal/composite/specular/emissive/mask/gray/noise suffix, that texture
  is used as diffuse. Applies to opaque and masked materials only; a translucent
  material's diffuse alpha becomes its opacity, and a guessed opacity is worse
  than the invisible fallback. Recorded as `sole_cooked_resource_texture`.
- **Unconnected DiffuseColor input.** An opaque Material with zero cooked
  textures and a `DiffuseColor` input carrying no `Mask*` flags is rendered as
  the input's `Constant` (default black). Cooked graphs strip the expression
  reference in every case; the mask flags are the observed distinction between
  a stripped connection (`Mask=1`, e.g. `Hanging_Monitor_Arm_Mat`) and an input
  that never had one (`Master_Black`). Observed on one material; not a format
  guarantee. Recorded as `constant_diffuse` on the material.

Sanctuary result after `refresh_materials.py --reuse-textures`: no-supported-channel
materials 64 -> 46, opaque ones 31 -> 13 (157 -> 54 placed sections);
`Master_Black` (53 sections) becomes black. The remaining opaque set is mostly
multi-layer snow/glacier/skybox materials with several `_Dif` candidates, which
this project does not resolve by picking one. The `Numerals` stencil and the sky
transition texture are non-DXT and stay blocked on the texture importer.

Counting clarification from the fresh 2026-09-14
[Sanctuary audit](docs/verification/SANCTUARY_MATERIAL_BASELINE.md): 46 is the
number with no supported channels, not all missing diffuse. Including
normal-only icicles and emissive-only spire instances gives 49 missing diffuse,
16 opaque definitions and 76 placed opaque sections. No material policy changed.

Automated checks: `ctest` 5/5, `verify_packages.py` all match, `level_test.py`
14/14 with new synthetic cases for both rules. Not done: a UE5 import and
viewer run with the refreshed manifest; the in-game appearance of the newly
inferred textures is unverified.

`tools/run_ue_level.ps1 -LowEnd` starts UE with DX11/SM5, lowest scalability
groups, FXAA and a reduced window for machines without a discrete GPU. Runtime
only; imported content and saved scenes are unaffected. No frame rate recorded.
