## 2026-09-10: Object records and first tagged-property reader

The reader retains name/import/export records and exposes `--exports` JSON.
Paths resolve through local outer references, with cycle/depth checks. Import
loading across packages remains future work. Names preserve numbered FNames
and convert serialized Latin-1 or UTF-16 strings to UTF-8 JSON.

`--properties <export-index> --property-offset <bytes>` starts at an explicit
offset relative to an export. A bounded reader prevents property data escaping
that export or a tag's declared size. Scalar values and object references are
decoded. Struct/array/unknown payloads are explicitly unsupported. The offset
is required because prefix serialization differs by object type; no universal
four-byte-prefix assumption is embedded in the parser.

Evidence: the installed WillowGame Default__WeaponPartDefinition (export 36066)
has a stream at offset 4 with 11 tags and an exact end at payload byte 860.
The four-byte prefix's semantics are UNVERIFIED. This is a class default, not
a weapon-part instance. BLCMM/in-game comparison is still required, so Phase 0
step 5 is only partially complete. No game payload fixtures were committed.

Build and all three synthetic CTest suites pass. Differential verification
checks all nine code packages' decoded bytes and export fields. These tests do
not establish struct/array correctness, inheritance/default application, or
arbitrary-object property-start discovery.
