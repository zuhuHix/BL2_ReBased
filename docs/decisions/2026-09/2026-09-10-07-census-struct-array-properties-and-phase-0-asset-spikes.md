## 2026-09-10: Census, struct/array properties, and Phase 0 asset spikes

`--census` counts exports per class path in one package; `tools/census.py`
drives it over every `.upk`/`.umap`/`.u` under the install and refuses to
report success unless every package read. Result: 2,008 of 2,008 packages,
4,751,329 serialized exports (see README). Two UHD files with a `.upk` suffix
are byte-signature-checked and reported as sidecars rather than failures. The
count semantics are serialized copies across packages, not unique assets; the
umodel plausibility check from the plan has not been done.

Struct properties decode either as fixed layouts (`Vector`, `Rotator`, `Guid`,
`LinearColor`, `Color`, `Quat`, `Vector2D`) or as nested tagged streams, with
a depth cap of 32. Array element types are not serialized in 832/46 tags, so
they come from an explicit `--array-schema` file per probe. This is a
deliberate stopgap: the correct source is the class's UProperty reflection
data, which needs cross-package class loading (Phase 1/2). A missing schema
entry leaves the array `unsupported` rather than guessing.

`--texture` and `--mesh` are single-object spikes written against the
serialization order documented in UE Viewer (MIT; read, not copied). Texture:
largest resident mip, DXT1/DXT5 only, inline or TFC-streamed, optional
LZO-compressed bulk. Mesh: first LOD, 16-bit indices, first UV set, section
material references. Anything outside that fails loudly. `tools/prepare_probe.py`
extracts `Ash_Road01` plus its material's actual `p_Diffuse` texture from
`Ash_P.upk` and records hashes in `local/probe/probe.json`. The PNG has been
viewed and is the expected road texture; the OBJ has not been opened in Blender.

Evidence limits: `AR_Barrel_Jakobs_Sawbar` decodes fully (13 tags, zero
trailing bytes) but its values are not yet compared against BLCMM, so step 5
remains externally unverified. The offset-4 prefix observation now spans class
defaults, material instances, weapon parts, textures and meshes but is still
UNVERIFIED as a rule.
