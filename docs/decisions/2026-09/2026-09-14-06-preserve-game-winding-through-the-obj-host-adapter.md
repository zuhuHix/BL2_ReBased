## 2026-09-14: Preserve game winding through the OBJ host adapter

The mirrored Scooter sign was traced to an extra triangle reversal in
`host/ue5/scene_geometry.py`. The extracted sign's 656 face cross products all
oppose its stored outward vertex normals; the former synthetic fixture used
the opposite convention. Reflecting Y positions/normals while retaining game
index order yields the correct OBJ handedness and UE face visibility. The
isolated sign now renders readable with unchanged texture coordinates.

Synthetic fixtures now use the game's winding convention. Saved UV validation
also compares oriented triangle topology; the pre-fix Southpaw scene fails this
new check, while the corrected isolated sign passes. See
[UV/winding verification](docs/verification/UV_WINDING_VERIFICATION.md).
